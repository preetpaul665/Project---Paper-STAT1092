## Description:

Group-sequential designs are usually economic in the sense that they have potential to reach to the conclusion for assessing the superiority of a treatment as compared with other treatments using less sample trials. Still they are not very prominent in the domain of applications of clinical trial primarily because of the complexities Involved in their computation and analyses. Till now the leading applications on group sequential designs are primarily on binary or normal responses which are very common response distributions in real life. In our work, while developing the two-treatment response-adaptive group sequential design we focus on count data responses which are emerging response distributions in the arena of biostatistics due to their wide applicability and unconventionality in this field. We will also try to improvise the prognostic factors in the existing design. Also we may extend the whole analysis for multi-treatment scenario.
